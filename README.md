# Aurelius

_Aurelius_ is an early-stage spaced-repetition flashcard web application. Designed for learners who 
value simplicity and focus, Aurelius helps you retain knowledge through proven techniques. While Aurelius 
is a web application accessible from any device, it is designed with the assumption that users will create 
and manage decks on a desktop, while card review will primarily take place on mobile.
